  // Nodes always have a 'depth' greater than their ancestors'.
  // There's no guarantee regarding depth between siblings. The depth
  // of a node is used to ensure that nodes are processed in depth
  // order. The 'depth' of a child can be more than one greater than
  // the 'depth' of the parent, because the 'depth' values are never
  // decreased: all that matters is that it's greater than the parent.
  // Consider a tree with a root node A, a child B, and a grandchild
  // C. Initially, A will have 'depth' 0, B 'depth' 1, and C 'depth'
  // 2. If C is moved to be a child of A, sibling of B, then the
  // numbers won't change. C's 'depth' will still be 2.
